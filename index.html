          <p> Climate Curriculum is a student-teacher collaboration effort to implement Climate-Related teaching
          into the core classes of Phillips Academy. The contributors of Climate Curriculum believe that the
          Climate Epidemic will best be dressed through inter-disciplinary learning, encompassing all members of 
          Andover's diverse community. Climate Tank allows the diverse array of students at Phillips Academy to build 
          and design their own courses, shaping Andover's curriculum to provide knowledge to address the climate 
          epidemic. <p>
